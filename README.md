# ColorGame
Month long project for AP Computer Science A - android game

At the end of the year, we were given an assignment called Operation: Create

This was my android application made for that assignment in Android Studio.

The game stimulates your reflexes and uses randomized sets of colors to do so.
It is both simple and enjoyable.
